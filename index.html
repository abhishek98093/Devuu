  Devuu, you have always been such a beacon of light in my life 🌟. I still remember when we first met in class 6, and even though I might have projected a hard personality back then, you always saw beyond that 💫. The way you've been obsessively loyal and deeply caring, from the moment you fell for me to the way you’ve showered me with love and attention over the years—it’s something I could never take for granted 💖. Every time I think of the journey we've been through, I realize how incredibly special you are ✨. Your kindness, patience, and unwavering support mean more to me than words can ever convey 🙏. You've always been there for me, lifting me up even when I overthink or when I’m stuck in my own head 💭💪.

  One of the best days of my life was when we met on 19th January. It felt like the world paused for a moment, and everything fell into place. The time we spent together that day will forever be etched in my heart ❤️. Whether it was laughing about silly things or just being in each other's presence, I couldn't have asked for a more perfect day 🌈.

  Another moment that means so much to me is how you always support me when I’m struggling or overthinking. I can’t forget how you comforted me when I was feeling down, reassuring me with your sweet words and making me feel like everything would be alright ✨. 

  And I can't help but smile whenever I think of the times you teased me or scolded me in the most loving way 💕. Your playful side, combined with your caring nature, makes every moment we share so unforgettable 🥰. Every little edit I made to our story, and seeing your reaction, is something I’ll cherish forever. Those moments show me how deeply we connect, and it makes me feel even luckier to have you in my life 💖.

        <div class="memory-box">
  Devuu, I want to make it clear, beyond any doubt, how deeply in love I am with you ❤️. It’s not just a fleeting feeling or a simple crush—my love for you is real, it’s constant, and it grows stronger every single day 💖. The way you have impacted my life, the way you make me feel like I’m the luckiest person alive, I can’t put it into words sometimes, but I need you to know—there is no part of me that doesn’t love you with all that I am 💫.

  You’re not just a part of my life, you are *my life* now. Every moment I spend with you, every laugh, every conversation, every shared silence—it all makes me love you more deeply than I ever thought possible. I am completely, undeniably, and hopelessly in love with you, Devuu, and I always will be 💕. You are the love of my life, and I will do anything to make sure you know just how special you are to me, every single day. 💍
